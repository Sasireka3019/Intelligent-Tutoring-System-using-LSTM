It uses a set of hash functions to map elements to bit positions in an array. If an element is added to the set, the corresponding bit positions are set to 1.

When inserting a new key, the Cuckoo hash table attempts to place it in one of the two possible indices.

Cuckoo hash tables provide efficient insertion, deletion, and search operations, and they are often used as an alternative to traditional hash tables."}, {"question": "What is the purpose of a Fibonacci heap?", "answer": "A Fibonacci heap is a data structure that implements a priority queue.
